# Nox-advancedchat
Lua plugin for old game Nox with lua support.

This plugin makes you able to bind lua function to a certain chat text. For instance, you can assign player suicide if he type "/kill"

NOTE: onConPrint is "on console print reaction" function with two arguments: text of message and color of message.
WARNING: onConPrint function will be replaced with plugin engine function! Use ADVCHAT_ONCOMPLETE(text,color) function to retain access to "on console print reaction".
